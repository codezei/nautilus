                                                <p>John started the idea for a telecommunications company in 2006, but the name Nautilus only came about in 2012 after he finished reading Jules Verne’s 20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. The name of the mythical ship appealed to him, and it stuck.</p>
                                                <p>His foundational expertise comes from his Computer Science background, but it’s his law degree that he credits to helping him grow Nautilus into the company that it is today. He believes that his time studying in law school helped provide him a better understanding of society as a whole, and it is what grounds him — which is why he leans towards running a business that is centered around justice, fairness, and honesty.</p>
                                                <p>Outside of work, John is an avid writer and reader. He regularly listens to classical music and is a purveyor of epic soundtracks. Despite his hectic schedule, John still carves out time for quick sprints on empty car parks to counter the sedentary lifestyle of a tech CEO.
                                                    His role models include Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Ayn Rand, and Simone Weil.</p>
